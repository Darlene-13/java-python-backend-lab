// Java variables are containers that store data in memory. Defines how data is stored, accessed and manipulates

// Key components here is the data type, variable name and the value to be stored
// Three types of variables are: Local, Instance and Static

// Important thing in variable declaratin is to know the data type of the variable and then name it, camelCase java naming convention

// Local variables: This are variables that are defined within a block or a method or constructor
// It is created at the time of declaration and destroyed upon the execution of the function
// The scope of the local variables only exists within the block in which they have been declared
// It has to be initialized first before being used

// Instance variables: They are also known as non static variables and are decleared in a class outside of any method or constructor or block
// Unlike the local variables, we many use the access specifiers for instance variables and if we do not specificy any access specifier then the default one will be used
// It is not mandatory to initialize them and the default value depends on the data type. For string it is null, float it is 0.0f, int is 0
// The instance variables are initialized using constructors while creating an object or we can use instance blocks

// Constructors:
// Think of a constructor like the birth certificate for Think of a constructor like the birth certificate for an object in Java.
// When you create a new object, the constructor is what sets it up, giving it a name, size, or whatever it needs to start living.an object in Java.

/* SIGNIFICANCE OF CONSTRUCTORS
* Ensure that an object is well intiialized before use...without constructors objects might have undefined or default values and risks the state of the object.
