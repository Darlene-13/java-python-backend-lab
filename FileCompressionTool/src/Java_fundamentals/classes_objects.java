// OOP in java structures the code to classess and objects.
// OOP keeps related data and methods together; this is called encapsulation
// It makes the code modular, resuable and scalable and prevents unauthorized access to data and follows the DRY principle

// OOP in java encompasses: Objects, Classes, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Inheritance

// A class is a user defined blue print or prototype from which objects are created; it represents the set of methods and properties that are common to all objects of one type, it is easy to crreate multiple objects that have the same behaviour.
// A class can be public of have a default access and a class body is sorrounded by braces

// An object is a basic unit of OOP that represents real-life entities.
// A typical java program creates many objects that interacts with methods, an object is usually made up of; State, Behaviour, Identity and method which is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and returns the result to the caller.
