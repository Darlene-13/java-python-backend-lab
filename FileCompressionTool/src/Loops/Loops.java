// Loops in programming allow a set of instructopsn tp run multiple times based on a condition.
// There are three types of loops in java: for-loop, while-loop, do-while loop.

// However there are couple of mistakes associated with looping, loops when incorretly used can be a sourcce of bugs
// The most common ons it the infinite for loop or the infinite while loop
// The other types of error is off-by-one errors which are causes when the loop runs one more or fewer by one time that it is required, this happens when the loop is not correctly set.
// Another one occurs when we change the loop condition inside the loop.
// Another error is caused by the empty loop body
